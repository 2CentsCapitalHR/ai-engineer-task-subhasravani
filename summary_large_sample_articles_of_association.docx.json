    "Share capital structure is compliant with ADGM regulations: The provided text states a share capital of AED 100,000.  The ADGM rules context does not explicitly state a minimum share capital requirement for private limited companies. However, without access to the specific Companies Regulations 2020 referenced in the document text (or further details from the links provided which I cannot directly access), it is impossible to definitively confirm compliance.  The lack of this information prevents confirmation of compliance."
